  Pablo Leñero Archer is a Mexican composer, pianist, conductor and creative producer based in L.A. Through his studies of the music of Bach, Beethoven, Cage, Armengol, Debussy and Bill Evans, Leñero explores the integration of the classical realm with the folkloric and indigenous traditions of Mexico and the Americas.
  <p class=" animated fadeIn delay-4s">
   In his music, Leñero experiments with alternative media and materials as part of the process of music creation, such as the use of  paintings and colors as scores, as well as using the physical space as a mean of musical expression.
